Caveats:
"1. Due to confidentiality constraints, sub-national death counts and rates are suppressed when the number of deaths is less than"
"10. Figures representing infant deaths and births have additional constraints for national and local data. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Assurance of Confidentiality."
"2. The population figures used in this table are the number of live births. Number of live births has been substituted for the"
"estimate of the population under 1 year of age to permit calculation of infant mortality rates. All rates in this table are"
"calculated by dividing the number of infant deaths by the number of registered live births in the same time period. It is"
"recommended that infant mortality rates be calculated per 1,000 births. More information:"
